## Scope

In scope:

- Signature validation bypass in simulator requests
- Data handling flaws exposing sensitive content
- Script-level vulnerabilities enabling unsafe execution

Out of scope:

- Cosmetic output formatting preferences
- Physical-access attack scenarios

## Disclosure Policy

Vyrox follows coordinated disclosure. Reporters are credited unless anonymity is requested.

## Known Limitations

- Simulated payloads are representative, not full vendor parity.
- Free-tier constraints can affect large-batch demo runs.

These are operational constraints, not vulnerabilities.
